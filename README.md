# Problem-2
Hangman

To run the test, just press Run on the editor (for Example: F11 in Eclipse Neon).

When the program is running, it will random a word that have been loaded inside of the program for each group (for Example in this program, there are 3 groups: fruit, animal, country). Each random words will be represented by underscore (_). For example the word "tiger" is picked from random process and it will be shown as _ _ _ _ (because the word "tiger" have 5 characters). The program will show you the hint that will give you a help when guessing the word based on the group. 

Then, you will input a character to get a guess for the word. When playing, you will also have the wrong guesses. The maximum wrong guesses is the same as the letter length count ("tiger" have 5 letters in the word, so the maximum wrong guesses will be 5 times). When you guess all of the characters without exceeding the maximum wrong guesses, you win the game. But, when you exceed the maximum wrong guesses before guess all of the characters, you lose the game.
